## Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

### What are your learning goals for this project?
- Ling - learning to make unit tests in JavaScript, learn more JavaScript and better understand object-oriented JS.
- Sal - OOJS learning opportunity.
- Kami - More comfort working on the front end, learning how to use OOJS.

### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
- Ling - a mixture of both, expecially pairing when a team member is stuck on something. Because this is so new for us, it will take a bit of both to learn effectively.
- Sal - comfortable with both, a little concerned about divide and conquer early in the project, in unfamiliar territory it's best to get a sense for everything that needs to be done together before splitting off.
- Kami - ultimately I'd like to be able to divide responsibilities, but for the time being, I think that we will learn the most and work best together.

### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
- Ling - direct, honest feedback. If anything is bothering you, please don't skirt the issue, and approach it in real time.
- Sal - directness without attacking. Focus on how to find solutions.
- Kami - constructive respectful communication, honesty about any issues up front.

### How would you describe your work style?
- Ling - when really focused, it could seem that I'm being aggressive, but really I'm just very concentrated on the problem itself. When really tired, sometimes I need to be reminded to take a break.
- Sal - collaborative, if you feel that I'm not offering my opinion, let me know. At times, I need to separate to think through a problem. I like to split up to solve these problems.
- Kami - I like to work together to move the project forward initially, and split out duties as we move on. I like to take individual breaks when stuck on a bug or problem for an extended period of time, then reconvene with ideas and solutions. Please redirect me if you feel that I'm going down a rabbit hole on something that isn't valuable to the project.

### Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
- L - Well - teammates are respectful of what other team members need to succeed. Poorly - when teammates don't listen, communication breaks down.
- S - Rest is very important. Productivity drops off at a certain point, and changing location/taking a break. Remain focused on the MVP, minimize scope until it's clear that we have the time to pursue additional features.
- K - Well - working together for set/predictable hours, especially at the beginning of a project, and splitting minor duties/research at night. Poorly - not communicating my need to take breaks or take time to focus on a problem solo, rather than pounding away without result.

### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
- S - I'm open.
- L - No mornings.
- K - I'm flexible, please no mornings. I love you guys.

### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
- L - accomplish the MVP and still remain friends with Sal and Kami
- S - same as Ling
- K - same
